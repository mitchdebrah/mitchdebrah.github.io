// A Blackjack Game

// This is a blackjack game with the following rules:

a.The player plays against the dealer (also known as the house) in my case the dealer is the player 1.

b.The player1 and player2 are each dealt two cards.

c.The first card of player1  is hidden from the player 2, but the other is visible.

d.value of a card is its face value for the numbered cards, 10 for a jack, queen, or king, and either 1 or 11 for an ace. The value of a hand is the sum of the cards.

e. The the purpose of the game is to have a hand with a value close to 21 without going over and also have a value greater than the other player.

f.an ace and face card count as 21, a winning hand and its a winning hand

g.Player1 will request another card if the value of the hand is under 17.

h. There are no ties in the game design on purpose, some casinos play by such rules.

// working on adding more features to make it more dynamic, like creating a draw function to call the game a tie when both player get the same number of pints.

// add images to give the card a real look  of deck of cards.

// make the the flip instead of popping out.
